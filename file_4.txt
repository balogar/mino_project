Throughout this work, we will always assume the probability space If not specified otherwise, we will assume that we are working on a locally compact, Polish (ie separable, complete, metric) space X equipped with Borel sigmafield B(X), with reference measure sigma Denote by B0(X) the set of all bounded Borel sets in X The aim of this chapter is to introduce the theoretic fundamentals and notation needed for further results (Locally finite measure) A measure µ on X is said to be locally finite if Let M denote the space of all locally finite measures on X and N the subset of M containing only measures that take values in N∪{0,∞} Further, we will denote by M the smallest sigmafield on M which makes all the projections µ ↦→ µ(B) measurable for all Borel sets B On the space N, we define sigmafield N by Elements of M (or N) are measures Although, we will alternatively handle them as locally finite random sets of points Therefore, we will write x ∈ µ for µ ∈ M (or N) instead of x ∈ supp µ Random measure) A random measure on X is a measurable mapping Point process) A point process on X is a measurable mapping Remark Point process is a special example of the random measure Measurable space (N, N ) is often called the outcome space of a point process on X (Simple point process) A point process µ on X is called simple if (Distribution of a point process) Let µ be a point process on X By the distribution of the point process µ, we understand the probability measure Pµ on the space (N, N ) given by Intensity measure) Let µ be a point process on X The measure on X defined by is called the intensity measure of the point process µ Intensity function) Let λ be the intensity measure of a point process µ on X satisfying for some nonnegative measurable function χ Then χ is called the intensity function of point process µ If χ is constant, we talk about the intensity of the point process µ Suppose that µ is a point process on X, and we wish to give each x ∈ µ a random mark y with values in some locally compact, Polish space (Y,Y), called the mark space In this way, we are able to construct a point process on the product space X × Y Let K be a probability kernel from X to Y, ie a mapping K : X × Y → [0,1], such that K(x, ·) is a probability measure for each x ∈ X, and K(·, C) is measurable for each C ∈ Y Further, for x ∈ X, we denote by δx the Dirac measure in x Definition 18 (Kmarking) Let µ be a point process on X and ν a random variable with values in N ∪ {0,∞} such that µ = ∑ν n=0 δxn  Let y1, y2, be random elements in Y, such that the conditional distribution of (yn)n≤m given ν = m and (xn)n≤m is that of independent random variables with distribution K(xn, ·), n ≤ m Then the point process is called a Kmarking on µ pthinning) Let p : X → [0, 1] be measurable and consider the probability kernel K from X to [0, 1] defined by If ξ is a Kpmarking of a point process µ, then ξ(· × {1}) is called a pthinning of µ Remark If a point process µ has an intensity function λ(x), then its pthinning has the intensity function p(x)λ(x) Definition 110 (Poisson point process) Let λ be a sigmafinite measure on X such that for all points x ∈ X it holds λ({x}) = 0 The Poisson point process on X with intensity measure λ is a point process η on X satisfying the following conditions 1 for every compact set B ⊂ X, η(B) is a Poisson distributed random variable with parameter λ(B); 2 if B1,Bn, n ∈ N, are pairwise disjoint compact subsets of X, then η(B1), η(Bn) are independent random variables Theorem 11 (Thinning theorem) Let p : X → [0, 1] be measurable and let ηp be a pthinning of a Poisson process η Then ηp and η − ηp are independent Poisson processes Theorem 12 (Superposition theorem) Let ηi , i ∈ N, be a sequence of independent Poisson processes on X with intensity measures λi  Then is a Poisson process with intensity measure Finite point processes Theoretical background related to this section is covered in Baddeley, 2007 Definition 111 (Finite point process) A point process µ on X is called finite if Let η be a finite Poisson point process on X with intensity measure λ and distribution Pη In this section, we will introduce the class of point processes having density with respect to Pη Finite point process with density with respect to the distribution of the Poisson point process) Consider a measurable mapping p : N → R+ satisfying A point process µ with distribution Pµ, such that is called the point process with density p with respect to the distribution of the Poisson point process η Theorem 13 (Baddeley, 2007, page 6263) For a point process µ with density p with respect to the distribution of a Poisson point process η with intensity measure λ on a bounded set B ⊂ R d we have for any integrable function g : N → R+ Remark The identities for the point process µ in Theorem 13 can be shortly rewritten as follows Example 11 (Strauss process) The Strauss process is a standard example of a finite point process with density with respect to the distribution of a Poisson point process A special case of the Strauss process is the hardcore process We will study this particular example in more detail in Chapter 3 Let B ⊂ R d , d ∈ N, be bounded set and sigma = Leb on B, where Leb denotes the Lebesgue measure of the corresponding dimension Denote by n(x) the number of points in a realization x ∈ N in B of some point process Let for real parameters β > 0, 0 ≤ γ ≤ 1 and r > 0 define the number of points in the realization x in B being close to u as a function and furthermore, define the number of pairs of points in a realization x in B being at most r units apart from each other as a function The Strauss point process is constructed as a finite point process having density p with respect to the distribution of the Poisson point process η with intensity measure λ = Leb, where α is the normalising constant Remark The normalising constant α is not in full generality available in a closed form as a function of variables β, γ and r For special choice of γ = 0, we get the hardcore process κr with parameter r > 0, for which we will derive the normalising constant in case of R 1 later on in Chapter 3 If we set γ = 1, we will get the Poisson point process with the intensity measure λ Point processes with Papangelou conditional intensity Papangelou conditional intensity) Let µ be a point process on X with distribution Pµ Suppose C ! is a measure on X × N that is absolutely continuous with respect to sigma ⊗ Pµ and satisfies for every B ⊂ X Borel set and A ∈ N Then the derivative λ ∗ : X × N → R+ of C ! with respect to the product measure sigma ⊗ Pµ is called the Papangelou conditional intensity (or simply conditional intensity) of µ Remark In fact, conditional intensity λ ∗ is defined to satisfy for all B ⊂ X Borel and A ∈ N the condition We can interpret the conditional intensity of the point process µ as the conditional probability that in an infinitesimal neighbourhood of some fixed point x ∈ X, there will be a point of µ, given we know the location of all points of µ outside this neighbourhood GeorgiiNguyenZessin formula) Let µ be a point process on X with Papangelou conditional intensity λ ∗ and intensity measure λ Then for all nonnegative functions f (Innovation of a point process) Let µ be a point process on X with Papangelou conditional intensity λ ∗ and intensity measure λ Then we define the innovation of the point process µ as a random variable for any measurable Remark By Theorem 14, we have immediately E[Iµ(ϕ)] = 0 for any innovation defined above [Repulsive conditional intensity] The Papangelou conditional intensity λ ∗ of a point process µ on X is said to be repulsive if Conditional intensity of pth order) Let µ be a point process on X For p ∈ N, we define the conditional intensity of the pth order as a measurable function λ ∗ p : X p × N → [0,∞) defined by for each measurable function f : X p ×N → [0,∞), where µ (p) is the pth factorial measure of µ Correlation function) Let µ be a point process with conditional intensity of the pth order λ ∗ p , p ∈ N Then the expectation of is called the correlation function of the pth order of the point process µ Notation We will further use also the notation for the first order correlation function For point processes with density with respect to the distribution of Poisson point process defined in Section 12, the following representation of the conditional intensity holds true Let µ be a finite point process on a bounded set B ⊂ R d with density p Assume that Then the conditional intensity of the point process µ exists and equals In a similar way as in Theorem 15, we can see for In this section, we will introduce Gibbs point processes with pair potential on the Euclidean space R d defined by the Papangelou conditional intensity Presented theory is based on Torrisi, 2017 A generalisation of this definition will follow in the next section Assume the space R d , d ∈ N, equipped with the Lebesgue measure Leb of the corresponding dimension Definition 118 (Pair potential) We call a function φ : R d → R ∪ {∞} the pair potential if it is Borel measurable and φ(x) = φ(−x) for any x ∈ R d  Definition 119 (Relative energy) For x ∈ N and u ∈ R d , we define the relative energy of interaction between the point u and the configuration x by Gibbs point process with pair potential) Take τ > 0 and a pair potential φ A point process µ on R d is called the Gibbs point process with activity τ and pair potential φ if its Papangelou conditional intensity takes form Let T = {τx, x ∈ R d} be the shift group, where τx : N → N is the translation by the vector −x ∈ R d  A point process µ on R d is said to be stationary if µ is invariant with respect to T Conditions for the existence of a stationary Gibbs point process with pair potential are given in Ruelle, 1970 We can not say anything about the uniqueness, so we always consider one such stationary process inhibitory Gibbs point process) We call a Gibbs point process µ with pair potential φ inhibitory if φ ≥ 0 on R d  Definition 122 (Gibbs point process with finite range) A Gibbs point process µ with pair potential φ is said to have finite range if 1−e −φ has compact support In Section 12, we have defined the hardcore point process on R d by its probability density Since the idea of the hardcore process is based on repulsive interactions between each two points, it is also possible to define it as a Gibbs point process with pair potential Example 12 (Hardcore point process with pair potential) Take r > 0 fixed and let φ : R d → R ∪ {∞} be a real function defined by Set the relative energy between point u ∈ R d and system of points x ∈ N as Then we define the hardcore point process with pair potential by its Papangelou conditional intensity Let µ be a hardcore point process on R d with pair potential φ and activity τ > 0 Then µ is inhibitory and has finite range Proof Point process µ is inhibitory straightforwardly from the definition of its pair potential It is also not difficult to see, that µ has finite range, ie function g(x) := 1 − e −φ(x) has compact support The function g is nonzero if and only if x ∈ b(0,r), which is a compact subset of R d Particle processes are point processes in the space of all nonempty compact subsets of R d , d ∈ N For further details, see Schneider and Weil, 2008, Section 41 Notation Denote by C d the system of all compact subsets in R d and set Let K ∈ C(d)  Then we denote by B(K) the circumscribed ball of K and by z(K) the centre of B(K) Further, we denote We define particle processes as point processes on the space C (d) equipped with Hausdorff metric Such space is a Polish, locally compact space (see Rataj, 2006) 11 Definition 124 (Particle process) Let C (d) be equipped with the Hausdorff metric, B(C (d) ) be the Borel sigmafield on C (d) and let Nd denote the space of all measures µ on C (d) with values in N0 ∪ {∞}, such that µ({L ∈ C(d) : L ∩ K ̸= ∅}) < ∞ for all K ∈ C(d)  We equip Nd with the smallest sigmafield such that the mappings µ ↦→ µ(A) are measurable for all measurable A ⊂ C(d)  Then a point process on C (d) is called the particle process Definition 125 (Stationary particle process) For a measure ξ on C (d) set txξ(A) := ∫ 1{K + x ∈ A}ξ(dK), A ∈ C(d) , and K + x := {y + x : x ∈ K} We call a particle process µ stationary, if txµ d= µ for each x ∈ R d  Theorem 17 The intensity measure of a stationary particle process µ can be decomposed as Gibbs particle processes In the context of Gibbs particle processes, we often use the reference intensity measure λ = θ/γ Also, we will make the assumption that there exists R > 0 such that (Gibbs particle process) We call a particle process µ the Gibbs particle process with Papangelou conditional intensity λ ∗ and activity τ > 0 if where g : C d → [0,∞) is a measurable, translation invariant function with property g(∅) = 0, called the pair potential Remark The existence of a stationary marked Gibbs point process is discussed in Mase, 2000 Definition 114 can be rewritten for an innovation of a Gibbs particle process µ as The following lemma gives a lower and an upper bound for the pth order correlation function of a Gibbs particle process These bounds are similar to those 12 in Stucki and Schuhmacher, 2014 for Gibbs point processes on R d  Although, both are derived using different methods Bounds in Stucki and Schuhmacher, 2014 are built based on Stein’s method for Poisson approximation (see Xia, 2005), meanwhile bounds that we will use can be obtained using the FortuinKasteleynGinibre inequality and the covariance identity (both in Last and Penrose, 2017) Take p ∈ N and denote by Up, Vp : (C (d) ) p → [0,∞) a measurable functions defined by (Planar segment process) Denote by S ⊂ C(2) the space of all planar segments with fixed length r > 0 Any segment K ∈ S can be parametrized as K = (x, ϕ), where x ∈ R 2 is the centre and ϕ ∈ S 1 is the axial orientation Take a > 0 On C (2), we define a pair potential We define the segment process ξ in R 2 as a Gibbs particle process with intensity measure λ concentrated on S, activity τ > 0 and the Papangelou conditional intensity defined as In fact, λ ∗ (K, x) = τe−aNx(K) , where Nx(K) denotes the number of intersections of K with the segments in x The directional distribution Q can be interpreted as an even probability measure on the unit sphere S 1
